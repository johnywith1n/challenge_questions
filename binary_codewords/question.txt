Given n, there are 2^n binary codewords of length n. All of them are taken and sorted to create a sequence: Sort by the number of 1-bits in the codeword bit-string. If there is a tie, break tie so that the smaller number comes first in the output sequence eg: n = 3 Sequence: {000, 001, 010, 100, 011, 101, 110, 111}

Input format:

n k

[Input consists of two integers n and k]

Output format:

Please print the codeword with index k into this sequence.

Constraints:

1<=n<=10
1<=k<=2^n
